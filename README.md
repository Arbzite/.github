# Arbzite

The name "Arbzite" appears to be a blend of "arb," which could refer to "arbitrage," a financial strategy that involves taking advantage of price differences in different markets, and the suffix "-zite," which might evoke a sense of technology or innovation, reminiscent of words like "website" or "appetite." The combination suggests a focus on automated financial strategies, particularly in the realm of investments and trading. The use of "zite" could imply a modern, tech-driven approach, aligning with the automation and AI aspects of the business.
